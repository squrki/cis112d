# Implement a client application(`client.py`) that connects to the server.
# Upon launching, the client should prompt the user to enter the name of the individual they're interested in.
# Send the entered name to the server for processing.
# Receive the response from the server and display it to the user.
# Utilize the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize data for communication between the client and server.
